# Test Plan

### Introduction

The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach. This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.

As the team works with the product they will define the needs for the second phase.

#### Team communication

All communication is performed though Slack and Github issues.

#### Objectives

The 1.0 phase will focus on manual testing for now and then we'll migrate to automation in the future. Preferably in next major test plan update, next app release will folow.

#### Scope



#### Application architecture

Application is written in Flutter framework. We need to have this in mind and choose appropriate tools and approach.

### Plan

#### Unit tests

#### Integration tests

#### End-to-end tests

### To test

### Test procedures

### Risks

#### We don't exacly know what devices our users will use.

We need to assume that they could use anything ranging from Samsung Galaxy S3 \(Android 4.3\) and iPhone 4s \(iOS 9.3.5\) to Samsung Galaxy Folder 2 \(3.8" screen\), Samsung Galaxy View SM-760 \(18.4" screen\) and Infinix Zero 5 Pro \(with Mediatek MT6757CD Helio P20 CPU\) ending with Xiaomi Redmi K30 Pro \(2020 release\).
